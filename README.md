# Recent Filter

[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/recent-filter/-/gui/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/recent-filter/)

Exclude specific files and folders from appearing in the list of recently used files.

Paths can be specified using wildcards, just like in a .gitignore file.
This means you can use patterns such as `*.txt`.
